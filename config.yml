    # To run another resolution, fix the raw=True calls to click and
    # the SOCKETS and SOCKET_MOVE_OFFSET dicts' values in tree_navigator
    # as well as X_SCALE and Y_SCALE which controls the ratio of
    # between the game's reported position for each socket and the

    # might lead to a whole swathe of other problems due to changes
    # in the relative position of in game objects
